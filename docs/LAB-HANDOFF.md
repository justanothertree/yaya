# Lab handoff — 5 Nov 2026

The state of `#lab`, the WebGPU room, at the end of the autonomous demo loop. The commits carry
the reasoning; this is the map.

**Nothing here is live until PR #17 is merged** — every commit below is on
`claude/relaxed-archimedes-oqxxq0`, and evancook.dev deploys from `main`.

## What shipped

| Demo  | Commit    | One line on the page                                                                        |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swarm | `94ad2d7` | Up to two million particles in a swirling current — a compute pass moves every one.         |
| Life  | `a3d48a5` | Conway's Game of Life — every cell's next generation worked out at once, on the GPU.        |
| Fluid | `091175d` | Fluid painting — drag to stir colour into a simulated fluid that swirls, spreads and fades. |
| Music | `2b4cbfa` | Music visual — your mic, a file or the instrument as bars or a ring, drawn into a trail.    |

Swarm was already live from #16; `a3d48a5` moved it into its own component without changing it.

A picker sits at the top of the room and remembers the last demo (`localStorage.lab_demo_v1`).
Every demo opens still under reduced motion and moves when Run is pressed.

### How each is played

- **Swarm** — press and drag to pull particles in (or Push them away). Counts 32K / 128K / 512K /
  2M; touch-only devices stop at 512K.
  Colour by Speed, Rainbow (hue follows each particle's heading, so every stream is one colour)
  or Fire.
- **Life** — drag to draw living cells, or switch to Erase, or pick a pattern and tap to drop it:
  Glider, Spaceship, Pulsar, Glider gun, Acorn (each tested to do what it is famous for — the gun
  fires a glider every 30 generations, on the GPU too). Speed 1–60 generations a second, three cell
  sizes. Keys with the board focused: Space run/pause, N step, R scatter, C clear, E draw/erase,
  1–5 pick a pattern.
- **Fluid** — drag through it; the pointer's speed is the push. Splash, Clear, four palettes, Swirl
  and Fade. Keys: Space, S splash, C clear, 1–4 palette.
- **Music** — 🎤 Mic or 🎵 Play a file… (the file never leaves the device), or play the Instrument
  and come back. Bars or Ring. Drag to steer the trail: across turns it, up and down grows it. Keys:
  Space, M bars/ring, 0 hold still. Leaving releases the mic and leaves music playing, as the
  Visualiser does.

### How the room is built

- `src/gpu/LabStage.tsx` owns everything that is not a demo: the adapter and device, a sentence for
  each way of failing (no WebGPU, no adapter, setup error, lost device with Try again), sizing the
  canvas in device pixels capped at 2×, the loop, the fps badge, and teardown. **One device per
  demo** — switching costs a new device, and in exchange one demo's lost device or stray error
  cannot land on the next.
- Each demo is `<Name>Demo.tsx` (controls, input, keys) over a `<name>Engine.ts` (pipelines,
  buffers, one `frame(dt, input)`), with its arithmetic in a pure `<name>.ts` and its shaders in
  `<name>*.wgsl`. Every engine takes `Pick<GPUCanvasContext, 'getCurrentTexture'>`, which is what
  lets it draw into a plain texture for testing.
- Every uniform is packed by hand, and every one is checked by `wgslLayout.ts`, which reads the
  struct out of the shader source and lays it out by WGSL's own rules. Reordering a field in a
  shader turns that demo's test red.

## Perf notes

**Every number below is from SwiftShader** — Chromium's CPU stand-in for a GPU, on a 4-core
container — at 480×270. That is the only adapter I had. Read them as **relative** costs; a real
GPU will be one to two orders of magnitude faster, and I have not measured one.

| Frame                          | SwiftShader ms |
| ------------------------------ | -------------: |
| Swarm, 32K particles           |           25.5 |
| Swarm, 128K particles          |          100.4 |
| Life, one generation, 5K cells |            2.2 |
| Fluid, whole pipeline          |           51.8 |
| Music                          |           11.8 |

- **Swarm scales with count, as expected**, and its draw dominates. The draw is deliberately NOT
  instanced: 32K four-vertex instances took 870 ms where one plain draw of 6 × count vertices took
  66 ms. Tiny instances are a known weak spot on real hardware too, so this is likely to hold.
- **Fluid is ~30 passes a frame** (splat ×2, curl, vorticity, divergence, 20 pressure sweeps,
  project, two advections, show), and the pressure sweeps are most of it. Twenty sweeps from cold
  only remove about a quarter of the divergence on a 64² grid (measured: 550 → 414; 200 sweeps →
  118), but pressure is kept between frames so the sweeps accumulate. If it looks springy on a real
  device, raising `PRESSURE_SWEEPS` in `fluidEngine.ts` is the knob.
- **Life is cheap.** A million cells is the cap (`MAX_CELLS`); the smallest cell size (3 px) on a
  1440-wide screen is about 81K cells (a ~1312×560 stage).
- **Music is mostly the trail.** It is a full-resolution `rgba16float` texture pair; halving its
  size would halve its cost if a weak device needs it.

### Device limits

Every demo requests a device **with default limits** and checks what it needs against
`device.limits`, not the adapter's (the adapter says what it could grant; the device is what is
enforced). The defaults are enough for all four: Swarm's largest buffer is 32 MiB of a 128 MiB
default binding, and its largest dispatch is 32,768 of 65,535 workgroups. Life's boards are at most
4 MiB each. Fluid and Music use `rgba16float` render targets, which every core device supports.

The "What your GPU reports" fold on the page shows the visitor's own adapter, limits and features.

## What was and was not verified

**Verified here**, in headless Chromium with a SwiftShader WebGPU adapter:

- each engine drawn into an offscreen texture and read back pixel by pixel
- Life's real shader against a CPU copy of the rule: 0 mismatches over 50 generations of a
  61×47 board
- Fluid's real projection passes against divergence measured on the CPU (curl untouched)
- Life's Erase, drawn offscreen: wiping the left half of a stroke leaves 48% of it
- Music fed by Chromium's fake mic and a generated 440 Hz WAV through the real file picker; the
  loudest band was 411–438 Hz
- every demo in the app with only the canvas presentation stubbed, plus `mobileAudit` at 1440 and
  375

**Not verified, and only a real device can:**

- **the final present to a real canvas on a real GPU** — headless Chromium here cannot present a
  WebGPU canvas at all (even a bare clear loses the device), so nobody has yet seen these on
  screen through the normal path
- Safari and Firefox
- real-GPU frame rates (the fps badge on the page will say)
- multi-touch: every demo follows one pointer

## What to try next

Roughly in order of how much they would teach:

1. **Measure on real hardware.** `timestamp-query` is an optional feature (it was present on the
   SwiftShader adapter); a per-pass GPU timer in LabStage would replace every number above.
2. **Boids** — the swarm with neighbours. It needs a spatial grid built on the GPU each frame
   (count, prefix-sum, scatter), which is the first demo here that would use workgroup shared
   memory and atomics.
3. **Reaction–diffusion** (Gray–Scott) — the same ping-pong as Life with floats, and paintable the
   same way. Small, and very pretty.
4. **Audio-reactive swarm** — feed Music's bands into the Swarm's current. Both halves exist.
5. **A ray-marched SDF scene** — one fragment shader, no buffers, the opposite end of what the GPU
   is good at to everything above.
6. **Multi-touch** for Fluid and Life — `pointerId`-keyed brushes; the uniform would need an array.

## Loose ends

- **The AudioDock's controls were all under 24px** — found by the audit while Music played a
  file, and worse on a phone (21×19) than at 1440, which the first note here had the wrong way
  round. Fixed in `fac6325`: 28px with a mouse, 44px under a finger.
- The Lab's own wording ("Experiments with WebGPU…") is in `App.tsx` beside the room's heading,
  not in `GpuLab.tsx`.
